# Real Time Predictive Analytics and Decision Making for Industrial Robots

This project was done as a contribution to fast emerging AI and Data driven society.
A runnable code is provided so that you can learn what our team has implemented. Full exact code has not been provided due to Non Disclosure Agreement (NDA).
Also, original datasets have been replaced with publically available datasets.

This project was basically implemented to forecast failure of drives of robot, so that we can reduce production costs in many big organisations.

Also, in some parts code has been made complicated. If you can figure out redundant code lines, you are already learning at a good pace.

Happy Learning! :)
